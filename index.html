        <p>I want to tell you about one of my favourite hobbies, which is cooking. I love to cook homemade meals, because they are healthy, less fattening and nutritious to eat.There are plenty of reasons to take up cooking as a hobby. Aside from health benefits, cooking is also a great way to explore other cultures. Trying new foods from different cultures can lead you to find new favorite dishes, but it can also lead you to a deeper appreciation of the culture and the people.
            <br><br> My favourite things that I like to cook are; Indian, Chinese and trying different kind of desserts.
